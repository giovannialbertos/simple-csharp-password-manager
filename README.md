# simple-csharp-password-manager
Simple password manager made in C# that uses SHA256 hashing to hash the master password and RC4 encryption to store the data. 
This is not intended for regular use, it is just a demo to show my abiity in csharp and object oriented programming.

## Features:
* The user can add entries to save site, username and password
* Ability to generate a random password up to 128 characters long
* The data is saved in a json file
* Ability add an delete entries
* Ability to change the master password
* RC4 encryption algorithm to encrypt and save all data (i know that it isn't the most secure, but I chose it for its simplicity)
* SHA256 algorithm to hash the master password
